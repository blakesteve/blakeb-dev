/**
 * First-load client JS per route, in bytes: what a visitor downloads to open
 * that page, and the figure `check-bundle-shape.mjs` budgets.
 *
 * Counted the way Next loads it: the build manifest's `rootMainFiles` plus
 * every file in the route's client-reference `entryJSFiles` (its layouts, its
 * page and the boundaries Next lists with them), each file once. Polyfills are left out: `polyfillFiles` loads
 * only in browsers without module support, it's the same file on every route,
 * and no change in this app moves it.
 *
 * Each route's cap is its figure here plus `ROUTE_SLACK`. A route the build
 * has and this table doesn't, or the other way round, fails the guard rather
 * than going unbudgeted: add or remove its row, measured.
 *
 * Why per route, and not the total it replaced: Turbopack writes shared code
 * once per group of routes, so the whole-build total counted a chunk once for
 * every copy. A regrouping nobody downloads twice could fail the build, and
 * real growth could hide behind a chunk that happened to merge. A route's
 * first load is what its visitor pays, whichever way the chunks fall.
 *
 * Measured 5 November 2026 on Next 16.4.2 and Roster 5.18.0, a clean copy with
 * `.env.local` beside it. X-ray's placed labels, in the layout and so on every
 * route, moved these up by 5,933 bytes from `main` at 35f42e9, and the longer
 * path in the nav by 6 more.
 *
 * Re-measure when you change one: a figure carried forward from an older tree
 * stops being a measurement. Run `npm run check:bundle` on a fresh build; it
 * prints every route's first load.
